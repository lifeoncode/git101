                <p>
                    The repositories in your machine are referred to as 'local repositories'. Git keeps track of files in your repos so they're ready for pushing to Github. (more on that on "remote").
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git init</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                   This will initialise a .git directory (which is usually invisible but can be viewed in the terminal or by modifying the settings). You're basically telling the directory you're in that you want to track it's content, essentially turning it into a repo.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git add 'filename here'</span>
                    <span>~$ git add .</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After creating or making any changes to files in the directory, you wanna go ahead and "add" those changes to the index. Otherwise Git registers them as "unstaged". The difference in these commands is just that the command with a dot where you'd write your file's name adds/stages all the changes, meaning you don't have to determine each file (that is, if you wanna stage them all). To find out if there are  any changes to files you run:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Git will return the 'status' of the repo, if there are any changes, relevant file names will appear in red but if changes are staged but not committed, they'll appear in green or gray depending on your OS:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>
                        On branch master<br>
                        Changes to be committed:<br>

                        (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)<br>

                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Otherwise:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>On branch master<br>nothing to commit, working tree clean</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Which just means everything's committed and up to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Git status output is pretty wordy. There's a more compact way to get the same result. If you run:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status -s</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Or
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status --short</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You get a more simplified output from the command.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To remove files on the repo you can run:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git rm -f 'filename here'</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This command will remove/delete the file from your repo completely. But if you just want to remove the file from the staging area, maybe it you 'added' if by mistake and don't want it's changes committed, you can instead run:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git rm --cached 'filename here'</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This will remove the file from staging area and Git will show it as unstaged if you run 'git status'. 
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>
                        On branch master<br>
                        Changes to be committed:<br>
                        (use "git restore --staged < file >..." to unstage)<br>
                                <span class="staged">
                                    modified:   README.md<br>
                                    deleted:    file.txt<br>
                                    modified:   message.txt<br>
                                </span>

                        Untracked files:<br>
                        (use "git add < file >..." to include in what will be committed)<br>
                                <span class="unstaged">file.txt</span>

                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    However, notice how there's 'deleted: file.txt' in the staging area... this means that file.txt still technically exists in the staging area.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git restore --staged file.txt</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This command removes file.txt from the staging area correctly. Very useful if you accidentally commit all the changes you make in your repo, you can then just pick which files to take down from staging area before committing.

                    Commit checks the index/staging area for changes that were staged "added", makes a snapshot at a point in time (which you can always go back to if you want a preveous version of your project).

                <p>
                    You'll run into something like this:

                    This is just Git requesting you to enter a commit message. A brief description about the changes you want to commit to the repo. Your commit messages should be descriptive enough for you or anyone to understand what you changed and why. This also makes it easy to travel back in time to your previous versions of the project. You can add a message to your commit in 1 command with:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git commit -m 'message here'</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You can undo your commit if you mess up your commit message or if you just think it isn't descriptive enough.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git commit --amend</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This command will output your previous commit with the commit message you specified, you can edit the message or just change it entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another useful Git command is:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git diff</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Git will show details about what exactly was changed, what was added or removed on which file/files etc...

                <div class="code">

                <p>
                    This becomes really useful if all the commit messages of the repositories aren't descriptive enough. Most developers don't put a lot of thought and effort into writing good commit messages because the 'log' can be self-explanatory but as the project expands with more and more features being added and updates being made, it can get confusing.

                <p>
                    The HEAD is your latest commit. This is the state at which your repository is at. There may be changes you've made after your last commit but they won't appear here as they aren't committed yet. From here you can do something pretty cool, revert back to a previous version of the repo. Here's how you do it:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git reset --hard af07d39fe744e58126827ddc3848d59a0189a801</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This command will revert the repo back to the 'initial commit' commit. This is done by 'resetting' the repo to a specified 'commit id' which is a string of characters which uniquely identify the commit.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git reset --hard</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Resetting without specifying the commit id will revert to your latest commit. This means any changes you may have made that weren't committed will be erased.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Git offers the option to view even more detailed information about the commit history of a repo.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git log --patch</span>
                    <span>~$ git log -3</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The first command 'git log --patch' will output the log with each commit displaying the exact changes that were made (much like running 'git diff').<br> The second command 'git log -3' will output only the last 3 commits of a repository, you can use any number you want in the flag, I just used 3 as an example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also chain these commands:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git log --patch -3</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Git will output detailed info about the last 3 commits.
                </p>
            </div>
