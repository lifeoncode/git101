            <div class="repos">
                <p>
                    The repositories in your machine are referred to as 'local repositories'. Git keeps track of files in your repos so they're ready for pushing to Github. (more on that on "remote").
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git init</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                   This will initialise a .git directory (which is usually invisible but can be viewed in the terminal or by modifying the settings). You're basically telling the directory you're in that you want to track it's content, essentially turning it into a repo.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git add 'filename here'</span>
                    <span>~$ git add .</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After creating or making any changes to files in the directory, you wanna go ahead and "add" those changes to the index. Otherwise Git registers them as "unstaged". The difference in these commands is just that the command with a dot where you'd write your file's name adds/stages all the changes, meaning you don't have to determine each file (that is, if you wanna stage them all). To find out if there are  any changes to files you run:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Git will return the 'status' of the repo, if there are any changes, relevant file names will appear in red but if changes are staged but not committed, they'll appear in green or gray depending on your OS, otherwise:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>On branch master<br>nothing to commit, working tree clean</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Which just means everything's committed and up to date.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git commit</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Commit checks the index/staging area for changes that were staged "added", makes a snapshot at a point in time (which you can always go back to if you want a preveous version of your project).
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git commit</span>
                    <br>
                    <span></span>
                </div>
