                <p>
                    The repositories in your machine are referred to as 'local repositories'. Git keeps track of files in your repos so they're ready for pushing to Github. (more on that on "remote").
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git init</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                   This will initialise a .git directory (which is usually invisible but can be viewed in the terminal or by modifying the settings). You're basically telling the directory you're in that you want to track it's content, essentially turning it into a repo.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git add 'filename here'</span>
                    <span>~$ git add .</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After creating or making any changes to files in the directory, you wanna go ahead and "add" those changes to the index. Otherwise Git registers them as "unstaged". The difference in these commands is just that the command with a dot where you'd write your file's name adds/stages all the changes, meaning you don't have to determine each file (that is, if you wanna stage them all). To find out if there are  any changes to files you run:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Git will return the 'status' of the repo, if there are any changes, relevant file names will appear in red but if changes are staged but not committed, they'll appear in green or gray depending on your OS:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>
                        On branch master<br>
                        Changes to be committed:<br>
                        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)<br>
                                modified:   <span class="staged">index.html</span><br><br>

                        Changes not staged for commit:<br>
                        (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)<br>
                        (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)<br>
                                modified:   <span class="unstaged">index.html</span><br>
                                modified:   <span class="unstaged">js/index.js</span><br>
                                modified:   <span class="unstaged">scss/style.css</span><br>
                                modified:   <span class="unstaged">scss/style.css.map</span><br>
                                modified:   <span class="unstaged">scss/style.scss</span>
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Otherwise:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>On branch master<br>nothing to commit, working tree clean</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Which just means everything's committed and up to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Git status output is pretty wordy. There's a more compact way to get the same result. If you run:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status -s</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Or
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git status --short</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You get a more simplified output from the command.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git commit</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Commit checks the index/staging area for changes that were staged "added", makes a snapshot at a point in time (which you can always go back to if you want a preveous version of your project).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you run:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git commit</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You'll run into something like this:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>
                        # Please enter the commit message for your changes.<br>
                        # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored.<br>
                        # and an empty message aborts the commit.<br>
                        #<br>
                        # On branch master<br>
                        # Changes to be committed:<br>
                        #       modified:   index.html<br>
                        #
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is just Git requesting you to enter a commit message. A brief description about the changes you want to commit to the repo. Your commit messages should be descriptive enough for you or anyone to understand what you changed and why. This also makes it easy to travel back in time to your previous versions of the project. You can add a message to your commit in 1 command with:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git commit -m 'message here'</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Another useful Git command is:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>~$ git diff</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Git will show details about what exactly was changed, what was added or removed on which file/files etc...
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <span>

                <p>
                    This becomes really useful if all the commit messages of the repositories aren't descriptive enough. Most developers don't put a lot of thought and effort into writing good commit messages because the 'log' can be self-explanatory but as the project expands with more and more features being added and updates being made, it can get confusing.
